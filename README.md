This repository explores how income levels relate to both crime (burglaries) and traffic accidents across municipalities in Canton Zurich, and whether there is an underlying relationship between crime and accident rates themselves.

## Research Question
How does income level relate to both crime (burglaries) and traffic accidents across municipalities in Canton Zurich, and is there an underlying relationship between crime and accident rates themselves?

## Approach
We analyse open data from Canton Zurich to investigate a triangular relationship between income, burglaries, and traffic accidents at the municipal level. By joining multiple datasets, we examine whether income predicts crime and accident rates independently, and whether crime and accidents share a connection beyond what income alone explains.

## Hypotheses
### H1 – Income and Burglaries
Municipalities with higher average income exhibit higher burglary rates, as wealthier areas may present more attractive targets.
### H2 – Income and Accidents
Municipalities with higher average income exhibit lower traffic accident rates, potentially due to better infrastructure, less transit traffic, or newer vehicles.
### H3 – Burglaries and Accidents
Burglary rates and traffic accident rates are positively correlated across municipalities, independent of income. Both may reflect underlying factors such as population density or urbanization.
